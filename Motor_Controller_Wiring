1. Logic Connections (Arduino to IBT_2)

Connect Arduino 5V to IBT_2 VCC.

Connect Arduino GND to IBT_2 GND.

Efficiency Step: Connect a small jumper wire from IBT_2 VCC to both R_EN and L_EN on the same board. This enables the controller.

Connect a PWM-capable pin on the Arduino (marked with a ~) to the RPWM pin. Let's use Arduino Pin 9.

Connect another PWM-capable pin to the LPWM pin. Let's use Arduino Pin 8.

Wiring the Second Motor Controller
You will wire the second controller identically, just using a different pair of PWM pins on the Mega. For example:

Arduino Pin 7 to the second controller's RPWM.

Arduino Pin 6 to the second controller's LPWM.

Connect the second controller's VCC and GND to the same 5V and GND rails as the first.
